- **Branch protection** - Required reviews for main branch changes

## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### DO:
✅ **Report privately** - Contact us directly before public disclosure
✅ **Provide details** - Include steps to reproduce the vulnerability
✅ **Give us time** - Allow reasonable time for investigation and fixes
✅ **Use responsible disclosure** - Follow coordinated vulnerability disclosure

### DON'T:
❌ **Create public issues** - Don't report security issues in GitHub Issues
❌ **Share publicly** - Don't discuss vulnerabilities on social media
❌ **Exploit vulnerabilities** - Don't access data you're not authorized to see
❌ **Demand immediate fixes** - Security fixes require careful testing

### How to Report

**Email:** Create an issue with the label `security` and mention that you'll send details privately.

**Include in your report:**
- Description of the vulnerability
